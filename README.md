# snake.js

A fun little afternoon coding challenge I did for myself: A snake game in JS.

This project was inspired by [a video by the Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM), where he built a somewhat broken snake game in p5 in about 30 minutes. This took me slightly longer, but it also works a bit better. Not perfect by any means though.

Built using koda.nu's framework because I'm too lazy to learn p5, but if you stumble upon this some day, feel free to change the code to work with any other framework (or vanilla JS). It should be pretty simple.

## Credit

Props to github/the0val for sharing some insight into how he made his Lua Snek. This snake is built on the same idea, though of course in object oriented JS, and with a different framework (duh).

Also some props to [the Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) on YT for the idea, even though I didn't use any of his code.

## Ideas for improvements

- Event based input
- Better input handling
- Better loss condition handling
- Better graphics
